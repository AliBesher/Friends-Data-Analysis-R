# Friends Series Data Analysis Project ☕🛋️

## 🌟 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of the famous American sitcom **F.R.I.E.N.D.S** using the **R programming language**. 

## 🏆 Academic Recognition
This project holds significant importance as it was officially selected by the **University Professor** as a **model reference and a benchmark example** for future Data Science students. It was highly praised for its technical execution, accurate statistical methodology, and insightful data storytelling.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Gender Speech Patterns:** Conducted a **Hypothesis Test (T-test)** to examine whether female characters have significantly more dialogue than male characters per episode.
* **Rating vs. Popularity:** Performed a **Linear Regression** analysis to determine the relationship between IMDB ratings and US viewership (millions).
* **Catchphrase Analysis:** Extracted and visualized the frequency of iconic phrases like *"We were on a break"*, *"Smelly cat"*, and *"How you doin"*.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
